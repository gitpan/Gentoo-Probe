Revision history for Perl extension Gentoo::Probe.

ver 1.0.5: Sat May 10 06:53:34 EDT 2008
	Removed useless and annoying CHLD signal handler from bin/pkg.

ver 1.0.4:
	Added MANIFEST depends to GNUmakefile for targets like dist.

	Added automated version updates to Makefile.PL.  Uses sed to replace
	__VERSION__ with the value of $VERSION from Gentoo::Probe.

	Added cvs ci and cvs tag commands to Makefile.PL

	Added proper module dependency list to readme, and to Makefile.

	Added ability to return an array of keys for keyword KEYS to pkg-faq.

	All tools now use environment variable / portage setting VDB_DIR for the /var/db/pkg
	location.  Is there a setting for this in portage, or is it hardcoded?

	Cleaned up the version logic (-v switch).  It used to report a version of
	gentoolkit with a number 'dev-###...'.  This was actually a different
	package, not a version.

	Changed the implementation of searches.  I always check both port_dir and vdb_dir
	now.  If you request -iv, I report the installed versions of the installed packages.
	If you request -uv, I report all versions of those packages which are not installed.

	Removed the local option parsing in Gentoo::Probe::Opts, and replaced it with the
	Getopt::WonderBra package.  It lifts and separates your args!

	Added Verbose switch, to control whether package names are included in pkg-files output.

	Fixed up the unit tests a bit.
