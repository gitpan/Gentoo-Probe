Gentoo-Probe version 0.01
=========================

Gentoo::Probe is a set of modules to allow the Gentoo package database to be
queried from perl.  It does alot of the stuff that qpkg did, but faster.

It also includes the following scripts:
	pkg			# lists packages, with options
	pkg-files	# given a package regex, list files.
	pkg-of		# given a file regex, list containing package(s).
	pkg-faq		# ask questions of portage, like portageq, but much faster
				# if you ask more than one question.
